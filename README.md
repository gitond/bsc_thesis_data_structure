This is a git repo containing my (Botond Ortutay) BSC thesis data structure for easier synchronization between different computers as well as version control.

It is based on the template available at https://gitlab.utu.fi/ttweb/thesis

I don't own, or claim to own the template copyright.

In order to correctly compile the .tex files into .pdf on a basic Fedora install, certain dependencies need to be installed. Underneath you'll find the list of dependencies. Note that multiple compiles may be necessary to get the pdf to compile correctly due to changes in reference structure during compilation. Might be adressed later by creating a makefile, but as of now no such file exists.

Dependencies:
texlive-latex.noarch
texlive-adjustbox.noarch
texlive-babel-finnish.noarch
texlive-pdfx.noarch
texlive-nomencl.noarch
texlive-biblatex-ieee.noarch
texlive-fvextra.noarch
texlive-datetime2.noarch
texlive-datetime2-finnish.noarch
texlive-enumitem.noarch
texlive-algorithmicx.noarch
